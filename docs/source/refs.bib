    abstract = {Robson \&amp; Whitlock (1964) considered point estimation and confidence limits for the upper bound of a random variable when the bound was known to be a truncation point. However, their approach to the point estimation problem failed to produce an estimator with smaller mean squared error than the largest order statistic from a random sample. In this paper we construct point estimators of the bounds of random variables which are substantially better estimators than the extreme order statistics for many classes of random variables, including those whose distributions are truncated at one or both ends. We also construct confidence limits and tests of hypotheses for bounds. The main results are large sample results.},

    abstract = {Most probabilistic seismic‐hazard analysis procedures require that at least three seismic source parameters be known, namely the mean seismic activity rate λ, the Gutenberg–Richter b‐value, and the area‐characteristic (seismogenic source) maximum possible earthquake magnitude mmax. In almost all currently used seismic‐hazard assessment procedures that utilize these three parameters, it is explicitly assumed that all three remain constant over time and space. However, closer examination of most earthquake catalogs has indicated that significant spatial and temporal variations existed in the seismic activity rate λ, as well as in the Gutenberg–Richter b‐value. In this study, the maximum ln_likelihood estimation of these earthquake hazard parameters considers the incompleteness of the catalogs, the uncertainty in the earthquake magnitude determination, as well as the uncertainty associated with the applied earthquake‐occurrence models. The uncertainty in the earthquake‐occurrence models is introduced by assuming that both the mean seismic activity rate λ and the Gutenberg–Richter b‐value are random variables, each described by the gamma distribution. This approach results in the extension of the classic frequency–magnitude Gutenberg–Richter relation and the Poisson distribution of the number of earthquakes with their compounded counterparts (Benjamin, 1968; Campbell, 1982, 1983). The proposed procedure was applied in the estimation of the seismicity parameters in an area that had experienced the strongest and most devastating earthquake in contemporary South African history, namely the 29 September 1969 Mw 6.3 Ceres–Tulbagh event. In this example, it was shown that the introduction of uncertainty in the earthquake‐occurrence model reduced the mean return periods, leading to an increase of the estimated seismic hazard. Additionally, this study confirmed that accounting for magnitude uncertainties had the opposite effect, that is, it brought about increases in the return periods, or, equivalently, a reduction of the estimated seismic hazard.},

    abstract = {This work is focused on the Bayesian assessment of the regional maximum possible earthquake magnitude mmax. The problem in the application of current statistical procedures for mmax is that seismic event catalogues are often too short to provide a reliable assessment of mmax . The remedy is to incorporate any relevant information about mmax in the computation processes. The roots of such information could be in geophysics, geology, tectonics, rheological behaviour of deformation in lithospheric zones, the worldwide database of mmax, and the seismicity of similar regions. Regarding anthropogenic seismicity induced by large water reservoirs, mining or fracking, the relevant information is available in the observations deriving from explorations of neighbouring mines and fields. The second problem in the application of the current Bayesian formalism for m estimation is that one of the components of the posterior max distribution is the sample likelihood function for which the range of observations (earthquake magnitudes) depends on the unknown mmax. This dependence violates the regularity property. The resulting likelihood function, therefore, reaches its maximum at the maximum observed earthquake magnitude mmaxobs, and not at the required maximum possible magnitude mmax. As the sample likelihood function is a key component of the posterior distribution, the posterior estimate of m^max, is biased. Here, a brief discussion is presented on the currently used Bayesian procedure for mmax and several alternative approaches are suggested.},

The statistical concepts of bias and variance are considered for each formula, and appropriate expressions for these are also given.

Eq. (7) is derived empirically from readings of torsion seismometers and USCGS accelerographs. Amplitudes at the USCGS locations have been divided by an average factor of 2 1/2 to compensate for difference in ground; previously this correction was neglected, and log E was overestimated by 0.8. The terms M2 are due partly to the response of the torsion seismometers as affected by increase of ground period with M, partly to the use of surface waves to determine M. If MS results from surface waves, MB from body waves, approximately(27)MS−MB=0.4(MS−7)It appears that MB corresponds more closely to the magnitude scale determined for local earthquakes.A complete revision of the magnitude scale, with appropriate tables and charts, is in preparation.

    abstract = {Abstract This study presents a method for estimating two area-characteristic natural hazard recurrence parameters. The mean activity rate and the frequency–size power law exponent are estimated using Bayesian inference on combined empirical datasets that consist of prehistoric, historic, and instrumental information. The method provides for incompleteness, uncertainty in the event size determination, uncertainty associated with the parameters in the applied occurrence models, and the validity of event occurrences. This aleatory and epistemic uncertainty is introduced in the models through mixture distributions and weighted likelihood functions. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using a synthetic earthquake dataset and an observed tsunami dataset for Japan. The contribution of the different types of data, prior information, and the uncertainty is quantified. For the synthetic dataset, the introduction of model and event size uncertainties provides estimates quite close to the assumed true values, whereas the tsunami dataset shows that the long series of historic data influences the estimates of the recurrence parameters much more than the recent instrumental data. The conclusion of the study is that the proposed methodology provides a useful and adaptable tool for the probabilistic assessment of various types of natural hazards.},
