# Ha3Py

Hy3Py is the Python package for
estimation of Earthquake Hazard Parameters from Incomplete Data Files.
The typical parameters include the mean activity rate,
the b-value of the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude distribution,
and the maximum possible earthquake magnitude, for a given area.
Additional parameters can be evaluated when an alternative seismic magnitude occurrence model
or a different magnitude distribution is defined.
Hy3Py can incorporate any quality of catalogue, including paleo-earthquakes, historical records,
and instrumental data, even if the catalogue has significant incompleteness.
